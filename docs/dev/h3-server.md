# HTTP/3 Server Development

Building high-performance HTTP/3 dummy servers for testing and development using QUIC protocol with Rust.

## Architecture Overview

The HTTP/3 server implementation leverages Quinn (QUIC) as the transport layer with H3 for HTTP/3 protocol handling. This provides low-latency, multiplexed connections ideal for load balancer testing and backend simulation.

## Core Components

### TLS Configuration
```rust
pub fn load_tls(cert_path: &str, key_path: &str) -> (Vec<CertificateDer<'static>>, PrivateKeyDer<'static>)
```

Loads DER-encoded certificates and private keys for QUIC TLS termination. Supports both certificate chains and PKCS#8 private key formats.

### Server Endpoint Setup
```rust
let server_config = ServerConfig::with_single_cert(certs, key)?;
let server_endpoint = Endpoint::server(server_config, addr)?;
```

Creates a QUIC server endpoint bound to the specified address with TLS encryption enabled.

### HTTP/3 Connection Handling
```rust
let h3_connection = H3QuinnConnection::new(new_connection);
let mut h3_server = server::builder()
    .max_field_section_size(8192) // Set the maximum header size this client is willing to accept
    .build(h3_connection)
    .await?;
```

## Test OS Socket is open or not

```sh
nc -v -u 127.0.0.1 7777
```

Expected output

```text
Connection to 127.0.0.1 7777 port [udp/*] succeeded!
```
