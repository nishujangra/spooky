# ðŸš€ Roadmap for Spooky (Rust HTTP/3 Load Balancer)

## **Current Status: ~15-20% Complete**

*âœ… Implemented: Basic HTTP/3 server, TLS config, logging, project structure*
*ðŸ”„ In Progress: Core load balancing implementation*
*ðŸ“‹ Planned: Production-ready features*

---

## **Phase 1 â€” Core Load Balancing (Weeks 1â€“4)**

ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Functional HTTP/3 load balancer (MVP).*

* [x] **Foundation (âœ… Complete)**
  * Rust workspace with proper module structure
  * HTTP/3 server using Quinn
  * TLS certificate handling
  * YAML configuration system
  * Structured logging

* [ ] **Basic Load Balancing**
  * Implement random backend selection strategy
  * Add backend server management and configuration
  * Implement request forwarding to backends
  * Add basic error handling and response streaming

* [ ] **Backend Health Checking**
  * Simple HTTP health checks for backends
  * Backend status tracking (healthy/unhealthy)
  * Automatic backend removal/addition

* [ ] **Configuration**
  * Backend server configuration via YAML
  * Load balancing strategy selection
  * Basic CLI arguments (--port, --config)

âœ… **Deliverable**: `spooky` binary that load balances HTTP/3 requests across multiple backend servers.

## **Phase 3 â€” Production Hardening (Weeks 8â€“12)**

ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Production-ready stability and operations.*

* [ ] **Graceful Operations**
  * Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT handling)
  * Connection draining during shutdown
  * Startup health checks and readiness probes

* [ ] **Error Handling & Resilience**
  * Circuit breaker pattern for failing backends
  * Request retry logic with exponential backoff
  * Connection pooling and reuse
  * Timeout handling for backend requests

* [ ] **Security Enhancements**
  * Automatic TLS certificate reload
  * Request size limits and DDoS protection
  * Access logging and audit trails

* [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  * Connection pooling for backend servers
  * Request/response buffering strategies
  * Memory usage optimization
  * CPU profiling and optimization

âœ… **Deliverable**: Production-hardened load balancer ready for deployment.

---

## **Phase 4 â€” Advanced Features (Weeks 12â€“16)**

ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Feature parity with established load balancers.*

* [ ] **Layer 7 Routing**
  * Path-based request routing (`/api/*` â†’ backend A)
  * Header-based routing (Host, User-Agent, etc.)
  * Query parameter routing

* [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  * Per-IP rate limiting
  * Token bucket algorithm implementation
  * Configurable rate limiting rules

* [ ] **Advanced Observability**
  * Distributed tracing support (OpenTelemetry)
  * Custom metrics for business logic
  * Alerting integration (webhook notifications)
  * Request/response body sampling

* [ ] **High Availability**
  * Configuration sharing between instances
  * Health check coordination
  * Consistent hashing for stateful backends

âœ… **Deliverable**: Feature-rich load balancer with advanced routing and HA capabilities.

---

## **Phase 5 â€” Ecosystem & Scale (Months 4â€“6)**

ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Kubernetes-native, cloud-ready load balancer.*

* [ ] **Kubernetes Integration**
  * Ingress controller implementation
  * Service mesh sidecar deployment
  * Kubernetes API integration

* [ ] **Cloud Native Features**
  * Helm charts for easy deployment
  * Docker multi-stage builds
  * Configuration via ConfigMaps/Secrets

* [ ] **Developer Experience**
  * Comprehensive documentation
  * Example configurations for common use cases
  * CLI tools for configuration validation
  * Integration testing framework

* [ ] **Performance & Scale**
  * Performance benchmarks vs nginx/envoy
  * Horizontal scaling capabilities
  * Memory and CPU optimization
  * Load testing and stress testing

âœ… **Deliverable**: `v1.0.0` - Production-grade, Kubernetes-native load balancer.

---

## **Success Metrics**

Rather than 10k stars, focus on:

1. **Functionality**: Successfully load balance HTTP/3 traffic
2. **Performance**: Outperform nginx for HTTP/3 workloads
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production deployments
4. **Usability**: Easy configuration and deployment
5. **Community**: Helpful documentation and responsive maintenance

---

## **Technical Architecture Evolution**

* **Phase 1**: Single-process load balancer
* **Phase 2**: Multi-strategy load balancer with monitoring
* **Phase 3**: Production-hardened with resilience features
* **Phase 4**: Feature-rich with advanced routing
* **Phase 5**: Cloud-native with K8s integration
