//! Operational policy vocabulary for runtime ownership and reload rules.
//!
//! This module is the **canonical, handler-free description** of the operational
//! contract frozen in Phase 0 (`machine-hardening-phase0.md`). It defines the
//! stable types that later phases build on:
//!
//! - who *owns* a runtime resource ([`OperationalOwnership`]),
//! - whether a config domain can change at runtime ([`ReloadCapability`]),
//! - what kind of runtime transition is being attempted ([`RuntimeTransitionKind`]),
//! - why a transition was rejected ([`TransitionRejectionKind`], [`TransitionRejection`]),
//! - the typed outcome of evaluating a transition ([`RuntimeTransitionDecision`]).
//!
//! It also carries a single source-of-truth table ([`RESOURCE_DOMAINS`]) mapping
//! every config/runtime domain to its ownership class and reload capability, so a
//! reader can answer "what can reload live?" and "who owns this?" from this file
//! alone — the Phase 1 exit criterion.
//!
//! # Phase 1 scope
//!
//! This layer introduces **no semantic change**. Existing validators keep their
//! current behavior; they are given a way to *describe* their outcomes with these
//! types (see [`TransitionRejection::restart_required`]). Wiring the reload flow to
//! *decide* from this table is Phase 2 work and is intentionally not done here.
